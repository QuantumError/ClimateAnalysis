The project is made using Quarto (see https://quarto.org/)

This project uses the Jena climate dataset from Kaggle:

Due to copyright limits, a third party download is used.

It is required to run the script script/download_data.py before running the project.

After that, you should run 'quarto render' in the terminal to render the html from the .qmd file.
